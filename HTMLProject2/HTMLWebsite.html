	<h1><b><i>World Schooling Family</i></b></h1>
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<div id="introduction">
			<p>
				Our family LOVES traveling.  Below is a list of our favorite cities around the world we've visited in recent years.  We've been trying to keep up a blog (<a href="http://worldschoolingfamily.com">worldschoolingfamily.com</a>) as we travel.  Hopefully there will be tips for other families and inspriation for those traveling with chronic illness.
			</p>
			<p>
				In less than 12 months our famliy went from completely healthy to having all three of our young children diagonsed with life long illnesses: epilepsy, autism and sensory processing disorder.  The kids teach the parents to fully embrace life and focus on the joy and positive.  
			</p>
			<p>
				How do you focus on joy when your kids see doctors from Baltimore, Maryland to Seattle, Washington?  How do you slow down and fully enjoy life when you have doctors appointment almost daily, often 2 or 3 in a day?  How do you stay positive when you go from soccer practices to staying up all night monitoring your kids for seizures that no one can stop?
			</p>
		</div>
		<h3>Finding New Footing</h3>
		<div id="lookingforward">
			<p>
				For our family looking forward and finding joy includes living a less "traditional" life style in the states and exploring living abroad.  One adult left full time engineering and entered school.  We unschool our kids now to support their specific interests and challenges that come with their specific needs. <br>
				What we've done to support better balance at home:
				<ul>
					<li>Unschooling</li>
					<li>Traveling as a Family</li>
					<li>Leaving fulltime work to remote work</li>
					<li>Reducing the number of commitments</li>
				</ul>
